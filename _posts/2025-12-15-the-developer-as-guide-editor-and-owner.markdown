You’re reading part 2 of a three-part essay. I believe it has never been more exciting to be a software developer than it is right now — and this series explores why.

I usually agree with and admire the work of Nassim Nicholas Taleb. I am not sure Taleb had software development in mind for this quote: "VERDICT ON ChatGPT. It is ONLY useable if you know the subject very, very well. It makes embarrassing mistakes that only a connoisseur can detect."^3 But this is exactly how I feel about the use of AI for software development.

The reality is that: most software developers do not write rocket-science code. We write a lot of boilerplate and repetitive code, which AI can produce faster than we can — so let it do that. That lets me spend more time with the business, so I can better understand the domain, concerns, and requirements.

If AI can write most of the code, what is my role then? LLMs make money by generating tokens. I often find that the generated code can be simplified, so some yak-shaving is required to get high-quality code.

From time to time, I hear the argument that code agents produce code of higher quality than humans. But LLMs are trained on code with errors, flaws, and technical debt — so how can they be so much better than humans when it is humans that instruct them?

When working with AI, I often generate a plan together with it before the agent executes the plan and writes code. This makes me a guide. I consider most code generated by AI to be a first draft, which makes me an editor.

Looking ahead, my future role remains uncertain, but I find the pilot-autopilot analogy compelling: it requires years of training to become a pilot, and yet most planes are flown by autopilots.

Vibe coding. I have mixed feelings about this concept — perhaps I'm comfortable with it for fast prototyping and exploring new ideas, but not beyond that. The key question is: who owns the code, you or the AI agent? I prefer to be responsible for the code. Currently, I work in an environment where I would not be comfortable having an agent own complex enterprise business logic encoded in software. In that scenario, I would be trading speed for deep knowledge (not to be confused with mere information). Code agents still sometimes get confused and give up. Would I be able to fix a critical bug in a larger codebase that I've never seen before? Maybe. For now, I'm not ready to take that bet.

And the reason isn’t just risk management — it’s that programming is more than producing code. It’s about building and maintaining understanding.
