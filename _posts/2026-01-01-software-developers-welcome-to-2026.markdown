This year, you'll be missing out if you don't start exploring AI agentic development.

You'll stay relevant in your current role if you're successful not only at developing great software but also at managing and participating in the entire software development lifecycle: talking to customers, understanding their requirements and wishes, and translating those into software. AI won't replace you because software development is so much more than writing code.

That said, LLMs are unreasonably effective at writing code — as Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis put it. So you need to figure out how to use them effectively for your codebase.

Don't get intimidated by all the frameworks and external enhancements that can be applied on top of code agents. As always, start simple and adjust your workflow once you get some experience. Pick one code agent to begin with and focus on getting familiar with its concepts.

Happy coding and happy new year.
