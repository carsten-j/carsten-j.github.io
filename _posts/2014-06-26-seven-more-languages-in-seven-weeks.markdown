I was recently asked to do a technical review of the forthcoming book Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks.

I really enjoyed not only the earlier book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks but also more generally the "Seven X in Seven Weeks" series from The Pragmatic Bookshelf so I gladly accepted the request. Seven Languages in Seven Weeks was actually the first computer eBook I ever bought. I have a long background as back-end developer using the languages C, C++, and C# and when I started my professional work-life the only programming languages of choice was C++ and Java. The concept of full-stack languages was non-existing. Over the last decade new programming languages has flourished and a few years ago, I decided to broaden my knowledge in this area. Hence, I bought Seven Languages in Seven Weeks and started an eye-opening journey discovering open source programming languages and tools.

Why would one want to learn seven more languages in seven weeks? Personally, I find it inspiring to see how programming tasks can be solved in other languages than those I use on a daily basis. During the last couple of years, functional programming has become a hot topic and functional programming is now used outside academia to build real world solutions. Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks cover several functional programming languages so if you want to get on board and see how to solve non-trivial problems with FP then this book is recommendable. Several of the  languages in the book were invented during the last five years so the book will also take you to the edge of new programming techniques.

Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks cover Lua, Factor, Elixir, Elm, Julia, miniKadren, and Idris and a beta version of the eBook is available for purchase [here](http://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks). 

I plan to write a proper review once I receive the final version so stay tuned!
