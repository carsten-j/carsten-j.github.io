Most people do not know the discipline chaos engineering. People that have heard of chaos engineering often refers to it as randomly terminating processes in your production environment. Maybe that was what Netflix did with their famous tool Chaos Monkey. What does a more elaborated definition says about chaos engineering and can you apply chaos engineering even if you not working for companies like Netflix? I was curious to learn more about such questions when I earlier this month attended the Fast Track to Chaos Engineering course with [Russ Miles](https://twitter.com/russmiles) at [skills matter](https://skillsmatter.com/) in London.


## Day 1
I really liked that we spend most of the first day discussing ideas, concepts, and theory before jumping into code samples and tools. There seems to be quite a few misconcepts about what chaos engineering is and can do for you, so getting that straight was really great.

Personally I do not like courses where the presenter use slides and browse through hundreds of slides. So I appreciate you took the time to write on the whiteboard while explaining the theory. The weakness in this setup is that there is not kind of course materials or documentation other that the notes that I took during the course. I right now, I really miss that. I believe that I managed to write down most things presented but I have a feeling that I might have missed some points since it can be hard to both listen, understand, and write at the same time.

## Day 2

A central part of day 2 was to create and execute a chaos experiment on your own system. I spend most of the time set aside for this exercise to get something up and running that resembled the environment that I work on. Hence, I did not have time to create the chaos experiment. I would have been great to know about this before the course start. It could be an optional exercise that you could prepare the setup before the course so you had time to focus on the actual theme.

## Day 3
The last day started 45 minutes late and ended 1:15 before time. So basically we "lost" 2 hours here. I explicit asked the course organisers when the course would finish on the last day and were told 17:00.

Day 1 focused on theory and day 2 on the chaos toolkit. The topics for day 3 were more diverse and included among other topics on

* organisational issues when implementing chaos engineering
* chaos maturity
* security
* build servers

All of the above topics are interesting but all the course participants were newcomers to chaos engineering and one need to be able to walk before attempting to run. So personally I would have preferred that we spend more time on the topics from day 1 and 2 before diving into more advanced topics.

For day 1 and 2 we were following the same theme all day and that made those day feel more consistent and complete. On day 3 we went through a lot of topics making it harder to follow.

# Conclusion
Overall I was quite impressed with the course and the presenter. I think it was a really good opportunity to dig into the world of chaos engineering and to learn about concepts and tools. Russ was very good at putting things into perspective and I learned a lot.

Day 1 was very compressed and we had a lot of extra time last day 3 so I would have preferred that we spend more time going through the material covered during day 1.

Here after the course I really miss having some kind of course materials and/or documentation.
