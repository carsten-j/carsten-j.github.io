wikipedia
Dependent types add complexity to a type system. Deciding the equality of dependent types in a program may require computations. If arbitrary values are allowed in dependent types, then deciding type equality may involve deciding whether two arbitrary programs produce the same result; hence type checking may become undecidable.

undecidability of type-inference for dependent types, and so on.



what is dependent types
not parametized types


why should you care


-----
predicate logic  - dependent types
propositional logic  Itâ€™s basically boolean algebra - haskell


only chapter 1-5. last chapter real world
