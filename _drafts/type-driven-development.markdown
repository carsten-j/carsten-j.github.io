I recently watch a talk by Philip Wadler from the Strangeloop 2015 conference. The title of the talk is ["Propositions as types"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU) and it is both recommendable and very inspirering. There is also a [paper](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf) with the same title with even more details.

Around 24:30 minutes into the talk Wadler mentions dependent types which was a new comcept for me and to be honest I am not sure I quite got his point.

A few days after watching the talk I received an email from Mannning Publications with a request for reviewing a book called Type-driven Development with Idris. It turns out that Idris is a programming language with Dependent Types. What a perfect opportunity to learn more about Dependent Types. 

Much of the material found online about dependent types deals just as much with type theory as with dependent types. I am a non type theorist software developer who cares about craftmanship and practical approaches to software development so why should I care about dependent types.

The title of the book got me to think about types and programming languages in general and development of types in particular. I have been developing software for 20 years and remember the first versions of the .NET platform and the `List` class that stored data of the type `System.Object`. It was easy to add new items to the list but extracting data meant a lot of casting leading to poor performance. It did not add to readabily that `List`s could contain items of different types. I was happy when generics were introduced in the .NET framework version 2.0. Great type improvement and the expressiveness of generics was just cool.

better type systems -> more expressiveness -> better programs

generics in C#. type improvement - Version 2.0 was released on 22 January 2006. 
10 years ago FP was not widely used and most people associcated FP with poor performance.

wikipedia
Dependent types add complexity to a type system. Deciding the equality of dependent types in a program may require computations. If arbitrary values are allowed in dependent types, then deciding type equality may involve deciding whether two arbitrary programs produce the same result; hence type checking may become undecidable.

undecidability of type-inference for dependent types, and so on.



what is dependent types
not parametized types


why should you care


-----
predicate logic  - dependent types
propositional logic  Itâ€™s basically boolean algebra - haskell


only chapter 1-5. last chapter real world
