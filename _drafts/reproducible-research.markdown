The term has many aliases, including:
I Reproducible research (RR)
I Replicable science (RS)
I Reproducible (data) analysis (RDA)
I Dynamic data analysis
I Dynamic report generation
I Literate (data/statistical) analysis
LSP and RDA are here used interchangeably. In my view these are
different from RR/RS.

The ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence is
replication.
RDA requires:
I Data
I Code
I Clear documentation (of data and code)
I Standard means of distribution



May be conceived as a stream of code chunks and human-readable
text chunks:
I Code chunks:
I load and prepare data
I compute a result
I create a table or plot
I Human-readable text chunks:
I Describe the data
I Explain analysis
I Present a result
Literate Statistical Programming
The programs or streams of text and code can then be:
I ‘Weaved’ to produce human-readable documents
I ‘Tangled’ to produce machine-readable documents
The basic idea is to combine
I a machine-readable programming language
I a human-readable documentation
